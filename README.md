<h1 align="center"> KotlinCraftAPI </h1>

##

This project is Spring & Kotlin equivalent to original [CraftMania's TypeScript CraftAPI](https://github.com/craftmania-cz/craftapi). 
This project was created solely to study Spring and to have a relevant code example. 

**Also, this project will not run unless you are connected to correct database. Experienced developers will be able to replicate correct database structure, but it is not provided for public.**
